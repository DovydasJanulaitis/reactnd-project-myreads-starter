# MyReads Project

This app allows user to categorize a list of books into shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read). User can search through a list of books in the search window and change status of any book.

App is developed using React framework

## Launching The App

To launch the app:

* Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/DovydasJanulaitis/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git`
* Navigate to the directory of cloned repository on your local machine
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
